Our Chabot is a conversational system that can be used in predicting diseases by generating automated responses to a user’s
input in real-time. It uses a selection of machine learning algorithms to produce different types of responses. 
The Chatbot will first ask your name, age, sex and after that, it predicts the disease by first asking the main symptom than the secondary symptom.
After predicting the disease it also gives you the description of the disease and what precautions you should take after it. 
This chatbot in health care has the potential to provide patients with access to immediate medical information and recommend precaution at the first sign of illness.
The real benefit of this chatbot is to provide advice and information for a healthy life.
